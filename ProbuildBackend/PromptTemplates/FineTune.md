## 🔧 FORMAT ENFORCEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

You must return your response using the **exact markdown structure** shown below.  
- **Every section is required** and must be returned even if values are placeholders.  
- Output must begin with `# Building Plan Analysis Report`.  
- The section `## **Construction Timeline by Task Category**` must follow this structure exactly:
  - Each task must be formatted as a **`### # X. Task Name (MasterFormat Code)`** section.
  - Each subtask must appear **bolded**, with a block underneath showing:
    - **Duration**
    - **Start Date**
    - **End Date**
  - Each subtask block must end with a horizontal separator: `---`.

**Do not skip or rename any of the following required sections**:

```

## **Final Bill of Materials**
| Item                 | Quantity | Unit      | Justification                          |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
|                      |          |           |                                        |

This report consolidates the construction analysis based on the provided materials and inferred tasks, ensuring a comprehensive overview for project planning and execution.

## 🎯 REFINEMENT TASKS

1. **Merge Redundant Data**: Consolidate repeated material entries or sections across multiple pages into a single, unified set. Example: merge duplicate mentions of 'framing lumber' into one entry with a clear justification.

2. **Resolve Inconsistencies**:
   - Standardize all units (e.g., board feet for lumber, square feet for drywall).
   - Normalize terminology (e.g., 'roofing shingles' → 'roofing material').
   - Correct conflicting values using domain logic (e.g., square footage ranges).

3. **Improve Structure**:
   - Maintain clear headers as shown in the structure above.
   - Use MasterFormat codes for all tasks and subtasks.
   - Ensure all subtasks use bolded names and horizontal separators.

4. **Enhance Clarity**:
   - Use markdown tables and formatted sections.
   - No bullet points in subtasks — use bold labels and `---`.
   - Tasks should be clearly separated by hierarchy.

5. **Generate Final Bill of Materials**:
   - Provide a single, consolidated table with items and justifications.
   - Categorize BOM under timeline task groupings, linked to MasterFormat.

6. **Apply Accurate MasterFormat Codes**:
   - Use authoritative codes from https://crmservice.csinet.org/widgets/masterformat/numbersandtitles.aspx.
   - If unsure, use the closest relevant section and note your assumption.

7. **Categorize by Tasks**:
   - Convert each BOM item into a main task.
   - Infer realistic subtasks (e.g., drywall → install, finish, paint).

8. **Group Tasks Together**:
   - Keep subtasks under their main task.
   - Sequence dates and durations from **April 16, 2025**, ensuring all subtasks fit within the main task duration.
